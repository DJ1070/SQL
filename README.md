# SQL

<p>This learning project combines web scraping from Amazon, data cleaning, SQL queries and Plotly graphs.</p>

<p>The single steps were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scraping product data from Amazon (Python 3)</li>
<li>clean it (Python 3)</li>
<li>clean a given file with sales data and replace wrong price information with the correct prices (Python 3)</li>
<li>combine product and sales data (mySQL Workbench 8)</li>
<li>formulate queries and extract new CSV files (mySQL Workbench 8)</li>
<li>create visualizations (graphs) for presentation (Python / Plotly) </li>
<li>build presentation containing insights and KPIs from the data </li>
<li>presentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the created / used CSV files were much to big to upload them on Github. Sorry.</p>
